# Botium Toys Cybersecurity Audit and Compliance Assessment

## Project Introduction
This project is a comprehensive cybersecurity audit and compliance assessment for Botium Toys, a fictitious company. The audit addresses key security controls, compliance requirements, and risk mitigation strategies needed to improve the companyâ€™s security posture. By assessing existing assets and controls, this project identifies crucial areas for improvement and compliance.

## Modeling and Evaluation
The project evaluates Botium Toys' cybersecurity maturity based on control categories aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices. Specific models and metrics used for this audit include:
- **Control Assessment Checklist**: Evaluates current controls across administrative, technical, and physical security categories.
- **Compliance Checklist**: Assesses adherence to compliance standards including PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 1 and SOC 2, using a checklist format to identify compliance gaps.

## Conclusion
Based on the audit results, Botium Toys should implement access control policies, a disaster recovery plan, and a centralized password management system. Additionally, the company should improve data encryption, intrusion detection, and employee access restrictions to meet compliance standards. Future work includes expanding the project to perform a more detailed risk analysis and integrating automation to streamline monitoring and reporting.
